nothing can get deleted unless the admin deletes it permamently

if u are a member and u appload and but it was a mistake then you have to edit that picut re and edi thte old one

as a mmber, it cannot be seen by any other member but there should be a recor dof it that the admin can only seen or maybe the project head

if its permanently deleted it goes away

even if its' ompleted you have access to that project

if u want to close the uploads, it's fine because it's fine but given the situation there must be a way for oyu to upload more but not edit para simple

if completed na, and opened for edits the it's still complted

indox yes/ntoifc of whatever movement within the project edit/add/delete

in order to do that u need to have a trail/log audit trail

notifications on deletes prioritize last

but on uplodas and deletes are more important

actually upload nalang 

every member of that project and admin

users:
- admin
- members
	- just members

so if something is uploaded, u set the settings for that file

just the project as a whole

access persmissions:
- can see
- can edit
- can download/upload
- can delete

project manager:
- delete
- upload
- edit
- see

what am i doing
