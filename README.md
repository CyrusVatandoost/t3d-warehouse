# About WareHouse

The goal of WareHouse is to serve as a repository for journals and researches for the TE3D House. It is designed to manage and organize the organization's projects and files. Although this repository is made for the TE3D House, it can be remodelled and reprogrammed for use by other companies, organizations, and institutions with the goal of file management and organization. This software offers a distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git.

WareHouse aims to support the business processes of  TE3D House. Specifically, the software aims to provide a simple interface which TE3D Members can use to browse through existing  TE3D House Projects. Furthermore, the software will also allow TE3D Members to upload projects of their own, which will be made available for viewing of other Members and Guest Users, with appropriate restrictions.

The site consists of different users with different access levels to ensure the integrity and safety of each record in the database. The administrator manages all the internal operations that are being requested by the other members such as the project authors, and the guests.

This software is made by ImagineWare Solutions, a group of individuals from De La Salle University. ImagineWare Solution hopes to satisfy the user with the software's contents.
